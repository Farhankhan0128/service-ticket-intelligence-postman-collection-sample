# service-ticket-intelligence-postman-collection-sample
A Postman collection and environment template that enables users to consume the Service Ticket Intelligence machine learning service.
Description:
In the SAP Service Ticket Intelligence User Guide Import Postman Collection and Environment section (https://help.sap.com/viewer/DRAFT/fb95f4cf368448be94f0eaed1583f491/1807/en-US/27cb414acd704da6ba93f46194cf6ac9.html), the user should be able to download 2 sample code files (Postman collection and Postman environment, as listed above). The user should import the files to the open source application Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) in order to consume the SAP Service Ticket Intelligence machine learning service. The files are templates that contain steps that call the service APIs. Further configuration details are available in the User Guide to enable the user to adapt the templates according to their needs. In every new release, these files need to be updated with the new improvements and features. Code lines might need to be added or removed, but the main sample code structure and scope remain the same.
